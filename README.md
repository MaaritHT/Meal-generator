# Meal-generator
Building AI course project

# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Describe briefly in 2-3 sentences what your project is about. About 250 characters is a nice length! 


## Background

Data is available country level and globally of different kind of meals. There is also lot of healthy, manufacturing and process related information. AI will give help to create new and balanced recipes for material, process and cost effect products.

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* healthy ready to eat meal
* produsable on sertain production process line
* recipe according national recommentation
* products marketing labels coverange


## How is it used?
With AI tool you can adjust valued different parameters, and design product to cover customer needs on different values. You can also plan meals cover different diets to avoiding allergens, gluten, meat etc.Describe the process of using the solution.

Images will make your README look nice!

## Data sources and AI methods
[Nutrion data]([(https://fineli.fi/fineli/fi/index)])

## Challenges

This system gives companies help to compare different kind meals and production solution on dashboard before decision time and material consumption way. There need still to be human to test and taste meals before final approvement of new meals for production

## What next?

Start could be planned for one type of meals etc salad portions and then get more different kind of meals available. Processing technologies and available equipment capacities etc should be implemented to program to get better accuracy for cost calculation.
