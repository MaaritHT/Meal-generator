# Project Title

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

For food industry there is numerous possibilities to use different components: vegetables, proteins, spices and marinade to create new tasty experiences for customers. To get most efficiency way to mining these recipes according to nutrition requirements and marketing labels as well as customer satisfaction this AI tool will give food designers new way of working at global an local level.


## Background

Data is available country level and globally of different kind of meals. There is also lot of healthy, manufacturing and process related information. AI will give help to create new and balanced recipes for material, process and cost effect products.

This is how you make a list, if you need one:
* healthy ready to eat meal
* produsable on sertain production process line
* recipe according national recommentation
* products marketing labels coverange


## How is it used?
With AI tool you can adjust valued different parameters, and design product to cover customer needs on different values. You can also plan meals cover different diets to avoiding allergens, gluten, meat etc.Describe the process of using the solution.

## Data sources and AI methods
[Nutrion data]([(https://fineli.fi/fineli/fi/index)])

## Challenges

This system gives companies help to compare different kind meals and production solution on dashboard before decision time and material consumption way. There need still to be human to test and taste meals before final approvement of new meals for production

## What next?

Start could be planned for one type of meals etc salad portions and then get more different kind of meals available. Processing technologies and available equipment capacities etc should be implemented to program to get better accuracy for cost calculation.
